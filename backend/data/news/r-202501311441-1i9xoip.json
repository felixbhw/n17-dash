  "title": "Richarlison revival, Van de Ven return, belief. How Spurs can save Ange [Tom Allnutt]",
  "content": "On the platform at Frankfurt station on Wednesday, a Tottenham Hotspur fan en route to Hoffenheim had just declared J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann to be her preferred successor to Ange Postecoglou when Klinsmann, to the group\u2019s delight, suddenly appeared upstairs, walking across the concourse, presumably also on his way to the game. If only Postecoglou could work his magic so swiftly, to propel Tottenham up the Premier League table, win a cup, or even just heal one or two of his 11 injured players in time to face Leicester City today at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. When Spurs drew away to Leicester on the opening day of the season, Postecoglou\u2019s side entertained realistic ambitions of finishing in the top four. At 2pm on Sunday, the aim is to strengthen the buffer between themselves and the bottom three. Postecoglou was back to his bullish best late on Thursday after the 3-2 win over Hoffenheim, insisting his team were \u201con the right road\u201d, that the players\u2019 \u201cbelief\u201d was all that matters and that his long and layered career had taught him the key in a crisis is to block out \u201cthe noise\u201d and \u201cnot get influenced by the current mood\u201d. After his downbeat and occasionally surly responses in recent weeks, it felt like something of a return to form for Postecoglou, buoyed by victory and up for the fight. Spurs are certainly not out of the woods yet, though, and any optimistic fans heartened by a gutsy win over struggling Hoffenheim in the Europa League should be wary, despite Leicester losing their past seven consecutive Premier League games under Ruud van Nistelrooy. After all of Tottenham\u2019s biggest wins this season \u2014 against Everton (3-0), Manchester United (3-0), West Ham (4-1), Aston Villa (4-1), Manchester City (4-0), Southampton (5-0) and even Liverpool in the Carabao Cup (1-0) \u2014 they failed to win their next match in the league. At full-time in Germany on Thursday night, three or four players looked dead on their feet. Yet there remains a narrow path for Postecoglou, a way to save this turbulent season and perhaps even his job. He is nearly two years into a four-year contract at Spurs and there is a belief at the club that he can still turn results around, as well as an awareness of the impact of the list of absentees. Interim appointments made things worse after Antonio Conte and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho while there could also be a middle way, where Postecoglou completes the season but another coach, with similar principles, takes the project on to its second phase. What is clear is that Postecoglou\u2019s tenure will be defined by the next few weeks, when he needs to get big decisions right and several elements to work in his favour.  Only Brighton & Hove Albion\u2019s players have missed more days through injury this season than Tottenham\u2019s and while fatigue has affected all areas of the team, the defence has been hit hardest. Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven are crucial to the way Spurs play, with their ability to adopt the aggressive, high line and make quick recovery runs, so losing both in November, just after each had returned from injury, has been central to Tottenham\u2019s downfall. The hope is Romero and Van de Ven will resume full training this week, which could put them in contention for Brentford away next weekend and then Liverpool in the second leg of the Carabao Cup four days later. Romero\u2019s leadership would be invaluable at Anfield, as would Van de Ven\u2019s pace against Mohamed Salah, but it will be a delicate decision to make. Postecoglou has to avoid rushing them back before they are ready because Spurs cannot afford to lose them again. With Dominic Solanke out for six weeks, and therefore missing both cup games against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup and Aston Villa in the FA Cup, the return to fitness of Richarlison is timely, although Solanke, who injured his knee in training last weekend, may not have broken down if cover had arrived sooner. Tottenham were open to selling Richarlison last summer but Postecoglou has to find a way to unearth the Brazilian\u2019s best version now, the player they signed for \u00a360million from Everton in 2022 and the one who scored nine goals in ten games during a golden spell under Postecoglou this time last year. Injuries have plagued Richarlison\u2019s three seasons at Spurs and he is a complicated character, with whom coaches have found it difficult to engage. Conte\u2019s hard-line approach \u2014 he called Richarlison \u201cselfish\u201d when he complained about a lack of game time \u2014 failed to stir a response and Postecoglou has never been one to cosy up to players either. A confident and healthy Richarlison could make all the difference. \u201cWhen Richy is playing he is Brazil\u2019s No9,\u201d said Postecoglou on Friday. \u201cWhen he played for us last year he was scoring goals.\u201d Lucas Bergvall and Archie Gray both dropped to the turf and lay flat on their backs at the final whistle on Thursday night, the exhaustion felt by Tottenham\u2019s two 18-year-olds clear for all to see. They have certainly benefited from the injury crisis, having been given more matches and responsibility than they could ever have imagined when they signed from Djurgarden and Leeds United for about \u00a340million combined last summer. At some point, Bergvall and Gray may look back on this period as a formative one \u2014 Bergvall has been deployed as a No6 and No8 while Gray has played right, left and centre back, as well as in central midfield \u2014 but they need to be managed carefully at a time when errors, a drop in form or injury could have lasting damage. James Maddison was visibly emotional when talking about Bergvall and Gray\u2019s contributions after the game. \u201cI went up to the lads like Lucas and Archie and said, \u2018Don\u2019t underestimate what you\u2019re doing right now,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re asking so much of them at such a young age.\u201d Even before Solanke\u2019s injury, Spurs were prioritising bringing in a forward in the January transfer window but they are yet to sign any outfield players, after the arrival of goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky on January 5. All of Tottenham\u2019s senior attacking players, apart from the returning Richarlison, are now either injured or exhausted, with Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski overloaded and struggling for form in recent weeks while Solanke, Brennan Johnson, Timo Werner and Wilson Odobert are all on the sidelines. The 17-year-old Mikey Moore has become an important option. Tottenham\u2019s league position and salary structure have made it difficult to attract the calibre of player they want, with Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Randal Kolo Muani making it clear early he preferred Juventus, while the likes of Manchester City and Arsenal entering the forwards market has also knocked Spurs down the pecking order. Postecoglou has admitted that \u201cpotentially\u201d there may be no more new signings, although there is a belief the market may open up once the league phase of European competitions ends this week and clubs that have not progressed decide they need to trim their wage bills. Spurs need to be ready to pounce. Tottenham cannot afford to be complacent about their position in the Premier League, with only eight points between them and the bottom three, but realistically they are not going to be relegated. According to Opta\u2019s supercomputer, there is a 0.07 per cent chance that Spurs go down, presumably because the teams 18th to 20th \u2014 Ipswich Town, Leicester and Southampton \u2014 are also rarely picking up points. With players back, Tottenham should pull up into mid-table. If that happens, Postecoglou might do well to consider using the league to rest and rotate, while directing the team\u2019s main focus and energy into the cups and, specifically, the Europa League. Fighting for the European places in the Premier League has always been the priority for Tottenham in recent years but their lowly position gives them a rare opportunity to concentrate fully on winning a trophy. And why not? Winning the Europa League would fast-track them into the Champions League and it is probably their best chance of silverware this season too, given none of Liverpool, Arsenal or Manchester City stand in their way. There are no Champions League drop-outs either after Uefa abolished that rule, which means that Athletic Bilbao, Lazio, Eintracht Frankfurt and Manchester United are probably the teams to beat. A first trophy since 2008, and first in Europe since 1984, would secure Postecoglou legendary status at Tottenham. Certainly, nobody would remember when they finished in the league.
